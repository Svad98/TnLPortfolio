    "text": "Overview\nI have begun to understand that a key component to becoming an effective teacher is being able to articulate my views on what it means to teach and learn. In so doing, I will be able to state what my goals are as a teacher and what I hope my students will gain from the classes they take with me.\nIn this section, I begin by outlining my initial thoughts on teaching and learning, to really bring out the impact my educational background has had on my perception of learning. While many of my experiences have made me more empathetic to the struggles students may face in the classroom, they’ve also been key in highlighting the biases and points of ignorance that I would have missed had I not written this out.\n\nInitial thoughts on Teaching and Learning\n\nTo conclude this section, I have my statement of teaching written out. This serves as a cohesive collection/balance between my experiences and knowledge gained. It acts as a “nod” to my past experiences, and articulation of the strategies I intend to use in class to ensure that my students become master innovators and thinkers.\n\nStatement of Teaching and Learning"

    "text": "Statement of Teaching and Learning\n\nNote: Phrases/words in bold are based on principles from Engineering Learning\n\nLearning beckoned me from a young age. My mother recalls my incessant pleas to be enrolled in the local kindergarten at the age of one. Although at that time I lacked the vocabulary to explain my longing for education, I now realize that I sought the adventure of transformation and immersion into a culturally diverse space. In each classroom, I was exposed to fellow learners and teachers who embodied the tribal diversity in my country (Kenya) through their attire, choice of food, and language. Despite these rosy beginnings, I swiftly realized the sinister side to our system of education: obsession with grades. From the first grade, we (students) would be lined up during the morning assembly and either shamed or rewarded for our grades on the previous exam. We were pitted against each other and taught to compete for the top score in each test to prove our academic worth. This shifted the focus from learning as a process of transformation and, instead, made it an anxiety-inducing experience. With teachers ridiculing us for asking questions or not always knowing the correct answer in tests, we began to fear unknowns and steer clear of curiosity. It wasn’t until I moved to the States for college, that my enthusiasm for learning was revived. My instructors encouraged my inquisitive nature, supplemented my curiosity with their engaging discourse, and constantly provided guidance in projects that were too foreign for me. With this stark contrast to what I considered the norm, I could finally feel myself transform. At last, I was learning.\n\nMy primary goal as a teacher is to motivate students to boldly approach the unknown. I feared the unknown for two reasons: i) a hostile and exclusionary class environment and ii) lack of guidance on how to get to the known. In my classroom, I intend to provide an explicitly inclusive environment where each student can freely express themselves without fear of ridicule. Additionally, I will practice and refine teaching techniques that equip students with skills to maneuver unchartered topics/questions. By applying these skills in an inclusive class setting, I will provide assessments to students that challenge them to explore new ideas to problems and provide a written and oral defense of their solutions. In this way, students will be tasked to defend their propositions and be given opportunities to improve their ideas through peer and instructor feedback. Ultimately, through continuous practice and constructive feedback, students will begin to approach the unknown fearlessly.\n\nThe boundless and frightful land of unknowns varies among students. To give space for each student to explore such lands, it is imperative to create an environment that includes diverse perspectives that students can relate to. This explicitly inclusive environment is quite prominent in the arts and humanities but is nearly absent in scientific contexts. I especially noticed this in graduate school, where ethical debates often failed to account for social contexts that would afford an offense some lenience. I also realized that most scientific texts covered in class excluded contributions from minority populations and were largely focused on Western medicine. Because of this, I intend to provide my students with opportunities to learn from the socio-cultural contexts of biomedical discoveries and established theories. This would allow them to learn how the basic concepts of biology came to be. By setting these innovations in cultural contexts, students would learn of how biomedical practices have shifted through time, populations, and geographical locations. Besides this, I will include readings and assignments that feature peer-reviewed publications from minority scientists, and other culturally distinct approaches to learning biology. This would give minority students the rare chance to “see themselves” in positions of scientific leadership. I believe that exposing students to the scientific method from such different sources would challenge their existing biases in the acquisition and application of knowledge. Giving students the opportunity to immerse themselves in something starkly different from their norm would not only establish and reinforce their empathy for others but also allow them to experience the discomfort of unlearning. In this explicitly inclusive space, through the process of learning and unlearning, I, and my students would be familiarizing ourselves with the new fringes of our unique unknowns.\nThe most renowned inventors and thinkers were simply skilled at using somewhat unremarkable events to explore new ideas. For instance, the rather simple kite experiment that Benjamin Franklin used to show the electric capabilities of lightning have since revolutionized our world. I believe that, besides learning all the complex details and fundamentals of biology, students should be educated on how to connect the dots in their knowledge reserves to make electric discoveries. By the time students approach the end of their undergraduate education, they are expected to be hubs of intelligent ideas. I, however, felt ill-suited to apply all the knowledge I had gained since I had scarcely been pushed to connect concepts from different biology courses to address a yet-unsolved research question. As a teacher, my goal is to equip students with skills that enable them to make connections between the known and unknown to solve scientific problems. In practice, this would begin with a prompt for students to recall what they know about a topic, connect their knowledge to the “big unanswered question”, and think of ways to address this question. If students are learning about inherited dental diseases, I would ask the students to recall what they know about inheritance. What do they know about dental hygiene and does this have anything to do with dental diseases? Such prompts would push students to explore the limits of their knowledge and look for ways to push those limits. By providing a guide on how to understand something that was initially unknown, I would accouter students with a “compass” to navigate unchartered topics. This approach would require me, as the instructor, to lead students, step-by-step, through the first few class questions, to get them comfortable with the process. Then slowly, I would let each student chart their own path as I provide reassurance and correction along the way. In this way, students will get to exercise autonomy of thought within the reins of the course objectives. This may yet reveal the beginnings of great scientific thinkers.\nPractice is a main part of how we gain mastery. To help my students achieve mastery in tackling any scientific problem, I will provide a few instances of formative assessments throughout the course. These assessments would be structured in a way that reinforces the concepts learned in class while pushing them to learn something new in preparation for the next session. For example, if a class session covers anodontia, a congenital dental disease, students will be tasked to identify the key genes that have been implicated in this disorder to recap the information gained in class. To push them to learn something new, I would ask students to provide a written summary of how the malfunction of these genes affects the normal biology in a tooth. What pathways are involved? Is this gene related to another disease that’s not related to teeth? Does this related disease share any similarities with anodontia? Through such assessments, students would not only practice the knowledge gained on a particular subject matter, but also relate that knowledge to other diseases or pathways. By connecting such disparate diseases, students would practice making connections between the known (material covered in class) and the unknown (a concept they would freely explore in the completion of their assignments). Besides instilling curiosity in students, such formative assessments would also prepare students for the summative assessment at the end of the course which would be a written paper on a disease of their choice, and an oral presentation on the same. With time, intense focus, and practice, my students will steadily be on the path to mastery.\nMy cross-continental learning experience continues to create wanderlust for the unknown in me. As a teacher, I hope to instill a similar sense of adventure in my students even in the face of challenging biological concepts. I aim to create an environment where each student feels included and equipped to handle the demands of my course, and others thereafter. Through this, I believe my students would appreciate the continuous and transformative process of learning. They would step through the door of something yet unexplored and leave having their perspectives changed. In the application of these remolded perspectives, they would acquire new skills, replace old beliefs, and make new connections to the world around them."

    "text": "Initial thoughts on Teaching and Learning\n\nDefinition or description of teaching\nTeaching is the dissemination of knowledge that can be applied and/or executed in both specific and other relevant contexts or situations for the purpose of solving problems, generating thoughtful discourse, or sparking innovation. Effective teaching is a display of depth of knowledge in a subject matter that is articulated in such a way that the gain of knowledge is sought after as a desirable treasure-quest instead of a means to the end of passing a course. As such, it depends heavily on the instructor’s ability to effectively communicate ideas to not only spark interest in the listener, but to instill creative curiosity beyond the duration of the class. I experienced such teaching in an Introduction to Sociology class in college. I recall walking into the class thinking of it as just another general education requirement that I needed to secure my graduation the following spring. However, from the very first class, the instructor drew my attention to matters I had become either disillusioned or indifferent towards including race theory, the glass ceiling theory, gender (in)equality and even the American constitution! He started the class, not by reading out the syllabus as was often the norm, but by sitting on the side of his desk and asking questions I had never even thought about (and there was no “right answer”!). This completely floored me and may have been the real beginning of my journey as a critical thinker. Through this course, I became more empathetic and open to diverse perspectives. More importantly, however, the study of sociology and social commentary has remained an active area of “pass-time research” that I engage in to date. An even greater indication of this effective teaching has been my conscious pursuit of sociology-based knowledge and its application in my interactions with colleagues, friends, and even strangers.\n\n\nDefinition or description of learning\nLearning is the process of acquiring knowledge, applying it, and being transformed by it. In my eyes, it often looks like Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s Little Prince: a youthful fascination of the world and pursuit of greater understanding of matters within and beyond our conscious perception. As a person who loves learning (my definition of it), I have realized that it is quite different from mindless absorption of facts and theories. I struggle to dispel the apathy and bland grayness within me that often arises when “learning” is a means to get a certain grade in a class. I have, instead, grown to appreciate learning as a bite into some Willy Wonka-style treat: a process of tasty, spontaneous, sometimes ordered, delightful surprises. Body responses are quite telling of exciting and thrilling experiences. In my case, I often feel the giddy excitement of learning when I break a sweat as my heart races: something akin to first-date butterflies. Besides this, I know when learning has occurred when my initial thoughts on a matter have been transformed. As many other humans on this planet, I have my biased, sometimes misguided opinions on matters that I can defend with such passion and commitment. I know I have learned when such set-in-stone-perspectives have collided with new knowledge and either broken or have been strengthened as a result. Referring to my initial contact with Sociology (above), I knew I had learned when nearly all my biases that had been a result of my upbringing or internalization of falsehoods, were debunked. And it didn’t stop there. I have been undergoing continual transformation with the information I’ve acquired through my study in sociology that allow me to bring unseen sides of a story to conversation. Learning is not only a transformation of oneself, but a transformation of others through conversation. I wonder how the world would look like if effective learning really was ruling the day.\n\n\nRelationship between teaching and learning\nTeaching and learning are like the semi-circles that complete a circle: the complete circle cannot be formed without the other. The most effective teachers have also been the most avid learners. They pour out from their ever-replenishing source of knowledge, often after they have immersed themselves into that experience of learning. Such educators are also well-known for their ability to learn from everyone, not just people at their level of education or renown. Learners, by absorbing this information, applying, and being transformed by it, engage in discourse and, often unintentionally, impart knowledge themselves, consequently stepping into the teaching role (albeit momentarily). In this process, a special kind of humility and bravery is required for both effective learning and teaching. Both paths often hit the wall of the “unknown” and require a sure meekness to press on without becoming disillusioned by the possibility of never really “arriving” at the predetermined destination. Isn’t the destination always changing anyway?\n\n\nInfluence of the learning environment on teaching and learning\nAn environment that fosters learning really breaks down the walls between students and instructors. These walls include: i) adherence to titles that often make the instructor seem out of reach, ii) the learners’ fear in challenging an instructor’s views, iii) the struggle for professors to initiate innovative and educative discussion in the classroom, among others. Reflecting on my past experiences, I recall the fear I had to even challenge unfair practices that were propagated by instructors in my high school years. We were at the mercy of each instructor’s expectations which were often too high and difficult to reach given the available hours in a day. Learning became synonymous with disappointment and failure cause that’s all it was ever made to feel like. The wonder of it all faded and fear took its place. There was an obsession with memorizing answers no matter how absurd they sounded with no room for a different perspective. My time at VAI has been a stark difference, with instructors and students taking more of a collegial role with open discussion, heated (but fun and respectful) disagreements, and a renewed excitement to learn from both sides. While it can be argued that these differences are due to the differences in level of education, I still believe that the model of collaborative learning and teaching can be applied to all levels of education, with the only difference being the intensity and measure of guidance from the instructor.\n\n\nTwo teaching pedagogies/strategies/methods that I’d like to use in a future teaching role\nRecall, Summarize, Question, Connect, and Comment.  I am particularly fond of this method because it is centered on drawing and applying previous knowledge to solve current problems in varying contexts. During my time as a student, one question I often heard my peers asking (and me along with them) was, “When am I ever going to use this information? How would this even help me in future classes/my career?”. While it is impossible to predict the future, this learning strategy is a timeless tool. It empowers students to get to a solution regardless of their expertise. It also has the silent beauty of allowing students to make connections that transcend the walls of a classroom. In a subtle but powerful way, the mind begins to transform.\nConcept maps.  I am quite enthused to incorporate concept maps into my lessons. While I have little practice making or using them, I have seen their utility in classes I have attended. Often, in scientific courses, the information passed on by professors can often seem overwhelming and disconnected. While I am all for the adventure of moving forward blindly, this, prolonged often leads to feelings of inadequacy and unpreparedness. I often find myself convincing myself that I just don’t know anything while, the more accurate deduction is that I just haven’t been shown how everything is connected. Making connections is much more efficient in learning than just absorbing information. That’s why I think that this would be a very important strategy to include. For example, I think that students would understand the point of learning a certain topic when time is allocated to filling in a new box after every key concept learned and showing how that relates to the previous concept and/or the main objective of a class.\n\n\nTwo ways I’d ensure all students have equitable learning opportunities and feel welcomed/valued in the classroom\nMaking uncertainty safe. Drawing from Chapter 6 of How Learning Works.  There’s something to be said about allowing learning to be a path forged by overcoming mistakes and pitfalls instead of one with the unspoken and unrealistic expectation of perfection. My past educational experiences have been riddled with the latter, and this has often led me to shy away from asking questions for fear of not having known. That’s the point of learning! We don’t know, so we learn to know more. Then we rinse and repeat. I want to ensure that my students are aware of this from the first day. I think this will allow them to step out, boldly, as they pursue the knowledge the course has for them. We all need more adventurers in our classrooms to propel change among their peers, within us as instructors, and in the world."
