# Pedagogy: Teaching Strategy

Developing my teaching philosophy started from my main goal as an aspiring instructor:

> Equipping students with the skills to _work through any problem or question_ regardless of their knowledge on the subject matter.

Here, I selected a teaching strategy that I thought best suited this goal and created a 3-minute video with the following information:

- The learning goal

- The teaching strategy to address that learning goal

- Demonstration of the strategy in a specific context 

- References/ways to learn more about the strategy

Enjoy!
